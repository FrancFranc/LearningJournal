# Day 10 - Feedback

Yesterday Duncan came to me and asked about my feedback and feeling.  I told him I don't feel good.  And good thing is he listened to me, and add more comments between codes at least.  I can see students like me understand more of what he's writing in class.   Well, some students might be feeling dumb of why Duncan's doing in this way.   I want to say is, if they know all the programming skills, they shouldnt come here.  Go and find a job.  

And today I was late in class, because I had a small car accident on my way to school.  Not having a good mood.  But I still have to finish the group lab work.  Well, I like the lab work.   I learnt quite a bit of html & css today.   It's good!
