# Day 6 - Salmon

Java Script is not as difficult as I thought.   FOr this assignment, I can do most of the javascript myself, except linking the html and script together (i.e. docment.getElementbyID), I still do not understand this part of codes.  I need to read the textbook again.  

If Code Fellows can let the students knowing to purchase the textbook way earlier ahead, this helps students a lot more.  They will have more time to do preparation, understand more in class.  The Codecademy has covered most of the topics about JAva Script in this class.  It is easier for me to follow.  But when the DOM comes, I have no idea at all.

Since the course is so intense, a long and great preparation work is necessary.  I would say it is not a good arrangment by Code Fellows.
