# Day 13

Yesterday, I and my husband had a meeting with Brandy, Sam, and VP.  I addressed my fear and frustration to them.  They think I'm doing okay, it should be fine.   I do not how to handle a question when I see it.   I found I have difficulties to combine altogether the things/codes that I have learnt.  Morgan shared her way of how to chop the assignment question into pieces and then do one thing at one time.  I'll follow her way.   

This morning I slept until 8am.   Really late.   But I feel much better.   Last few days I was so tired, mentally.   Usually I made my lunch before school.   But I didnt want to do so in last couple days.   Felt really tired.   Probably I'll make it tonight coz my bad mood kinda seems went away.
