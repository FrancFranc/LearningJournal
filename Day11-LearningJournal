# Day 11 - Image clicks

I had a really bad day.   I found my car got broke in before going to school.    All valuable things gone.   I couldnt pay attention in class.  I tracked the thief's location.   He was using my tablet. I can see my tablet's status on my computer, right in front of me.  But police didnt come.  NO one catch him.   I cant do nothing.   Bad things come up one by one.  I really dont have mood.

Yesterday I tried to do my assignment, I watched Duncan's video again and again.   I dont even how to start my assignment.  USe an array?  constructor?  how to link the image url to java script?  I screamed at home.   Feeling really angry and I read the textbook, it is useless.   It cannot help me.    I watched his video, nth help much.
