# Day 8 - Salmon Cookies  

Feeling really frustrated.   Assignments are piling up everyday.   I am scared, because I cannot finish the assignments.   Every classmate seems has already moved on to yesterday's work.   I feel like I have fallen behind.   I don't see the point on keep doing the lab work, I want to read and learn, not just doing assignment.  And yesterday I stopped struggling in the lab work, I took a day to read textbook and Duncan's code.  Otherwise I will not know how to do the lab work.   Tonight I finally started doing yesterday's one.   Good.
