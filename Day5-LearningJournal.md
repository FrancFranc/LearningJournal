# Day 5 - Images, Color, and Text

I  have learnt things that I have expected to learn.   Originally I have a pretty high expectation on this course, but I found the longer the days, the less the excitement of this class.

I don't understand how the instructor can expect the students(who without programming knowledge / IT background) will understand what he's coding in class.   Without a page of codes, how can I jot notes next to the lines?   If I don't type out the codes, how can the notes that I have jotted be referred to?   Does that make any sense?   The instructor asked us not to copy his codes, otherwise we cannot follow.  Is he kidding?  If he does not provide the codes or example he's gonna talk about on that day, how can I follow?  

The students who understand what the instructor is talking about, or are able to answer his questions are those who have programming knowledge / IT background.

Maybe my words are too mean, but this is how I talk to my manager when I see problems.
