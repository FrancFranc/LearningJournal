# Day 2 - Terminal


In the beginning of the class, I have already got lost of what the instructor was talking about.  I tried to keep following his way.  I kinda understood what he's trying to say, and guessing might be he's talking sth like "cloud".  Upload my work to GitHub and synchronize the progress.  However, he talked too fast and jumped to the next command to fast, I couldn't follow. I was a bit scared, coz he said if we lose track for more than 15 min, we should let him/someone know.  That's no good.  Glad that the TAs are really helpful, even though I don't really understand what they are trying to tell me.  But the more they explain, the more I understand.  

After class, I really do not want to stuck with my existing repo, what a mess.  So I just chose to delete all the files and redo it again, I guess it is the right way to learn from the beginning.  It works.   Now I understand.  

It's only my second day in class.  I don't have much comment on the course, since the only knowledge about coding is from Codecademy.  The terminal thingee is whole new thing for me.  We'll know more when this course goes farther.
