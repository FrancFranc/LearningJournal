# Day 3 - Lists, The Box Model, and Loops


It seems I'm doing better on the Terminal much  better today.   At least I know whats going on with the git codes.  And then I 've learnt the a new thing called "branch" today.

Since I always misread the questions of lab, kinda waste time to re-do and re-do my assignment. I don't feel good on this.
