# Last Day of Class 201

Finally it comes to the end of class 201.  Even though it is really stressful (together with my two car incidents), I do really learn a lot.  I wanna thank Duncan of understanding my emotions and difficulties.  He tried to help me.  I appreciate that a lot.  I am happy to have such good classmates.  I never studied overseas, therefore they are my first group of foreign classmates in my life.   Feel good. Haha.  

I came to Seattle two years ago.  I have difficult time to adapt my living in here.  I don't know what I can do.  Everything and every skill that I have, becoming useless in here, except my English speaking.  Reason why I seemed so frustrated in last week is relating to my future in here.  Well, this problem is too complicated, I dont think I can elaborate all in this journal. Hahaha.

One thing I really want to tell anyone who will read this journal is, please, ask students to read the chapter about debugging right after the instructor has taught function & objects.  It is very useful.  You have to know one fact :  "Knowing what function is, doesnt mean understanding what a function is."   Might be you have forgetten when you were a student, you know nothing about programming, and you have to find out what a function is.   When a function is nested with another function, what will happen?  Which comes first?  What's the flow?   How java script read it?   Why you can call a function before declaring it?


I will say not knowing this chapter earlier is a mistake.  A total mistake.
